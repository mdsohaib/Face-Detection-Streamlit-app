  <h2> <i> Face Detection App </i> </h2>
<p><i> Face detection -- also called facial detection is an artificial intelligence (Al) based computer technology used to find and identify human faces in digital images or video settings. Face detection technology can be applied to various fields -- including security, biometrics, law enforcement, etc.</p>

<br>


  <h2> Details of the Project </h2>

<p>
The Project is divided into two parts:

1. Understanding streamlit and how it works, why opt for using streamlit. <br>
  2. Using Haar cascades to detect faces in a video stream.</p>
  
<br><br>
<h2> <i>Streamlit</i> </h2>
<p><i>Streamlit is an awesome new tool that allows engineers to quickly build highly interactive web applications around their data, machine learning models, and pretty much anything. The best thing about Streamlit is it doesn't require any knowledge of web development. If you know Python, you're good to go! </p>
  <br> <br>

<p><i> For Face detection App there are many ways to implement this and for various You could build a model from scratch and train of lots of images that have faces, or you could use a pretrained model and work on images. We will be using Haar cascade classifier that are based on machine learning approach.</p>
