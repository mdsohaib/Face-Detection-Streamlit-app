  <h2> <i> Face Detection App </i> </h2>
<p><i> For Face detection App there are many ways to implement this and for various You could build a model from scratch and train of lots of images that have faces, or you could use a pretrained model and work on images. We will be using Haar cascade classifier that are based on machine learning approach.</p>

<br>
  
  <h2> <i>Image Classification </i> </h2>
<p><i>Image classification refers to the task of extracting information classes from a multiband raster image Depending on the interaction between the analyst and the computer during classification, there are two types of classification: supervised and unsupervised We will be working with supervised image classification</p>

<br>


  <h2> Details of the Project </h2>

<p>

The Project is divided into three parts: <br>

1. Using classes like mobilenets for image classification <br>

2- Building our own model for image classification <br>

3. We build a web app with flask to mount the prediction model  </p>
  
<br><br>
<h2> <i>Machine Learning Model </i> </h2>
<p><i>So we start off with preprocessing the model using ImageDataGenerator class and then move forward with training our model </p>
  <br> <br>
  
  <h2> <i>Flask Web App  </i> </h2>
<p><i>SThis is the second part where we build the web application using the framework Flask We mount the model we build in the previous part on the Flask project</p>
